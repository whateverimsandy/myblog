## Ideation

I want to create a stunning snowstorm scene that captures the explosive effect of snow being whipped around by strong winds. And to make it even more engaging, I'm planning to let users control the rotation of the snow using their mouse. It's intersting to see the snow swirling around and changing direction in real-time!
With the use of technology (coding) to simulate natural phenomena can be fascinating and impressive, especially if it's done in a way that is visually striking and realistic. And lastly, the interactive aspect of the project adds a layer of engagement and interactivity that can make the experience more immersive and enjoyable for users
