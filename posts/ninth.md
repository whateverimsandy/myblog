## Ideation

Choosing a quote in Chapter 1 of 'On Earth We're briefly gorgeous'.

The quote:

"It only takes a single night of frost to kill off a generation. To live, then,
is a matter of time, of timing." - Ocean Vuong

Then make it a digital art piece having the image of a monarch being torn into pieces in storm. Flying pieces also resemble for the frost and wind
