# Ideation

My idea was to have the background tranforms from a blank canvas that later on reveal a hidden message 'RMIT creative coding specialisation' underneath.

Taking inspiraton from the stop-motion movie 'Coraline'

My banner ideation is to place the text (in white colour) into a blank canvas. After interaction (clicking to logo). A squirling line will appear and fully cover the canvas like a spider-web
 # Used functions & techniques inspiration
