## Ideation

For my final assignment, I am continuing my exploration of net art using p5.js, and I am fortunate to have a book-loving friend group as my community of practice. I decided to have a collaborative journey with them to create a net art piece based on our favorite quotes from Ocean Vuong's novel, "On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous." By combining our chosen quotes that’s full of imagery, the aim is to create a visually captivating net art piece that explores the poetic world within the novel. To enrich the user experience, I plan to add ambient sound to create an immersive atmosphere that evokes  the spirit and emotions of the novel, offering a profound and engaging experience for my community of practice.


Selected quotes and symbolism:


The eye, the monarch, migration, generation, ghost, loneliness

Community of practice : Book-loving friends (make sure that they already read the novel)
•	domain = Mac computer lab
•	repertoire = sitting down
•	shared values (attitudes / norms) = (deep) thinking, observing
