## Ideation

Learning recursion in class. I've been inspired to come up with a really cool idea for an artwork that incorporates this concept. Basically, I want to create a mesmerizing visual experience by using a circular graphic that changes color in a repetitive loop. But that's not all - I'm also going to have the background change colors in a loop, too! And to really take things up a notch, I'm going to use random colors to create a hypnotic, almost trance-like effect as the colors and motion blend together in an endlessly repeating cycle.
