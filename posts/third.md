# Ideation

Another idea of having the hidden message reveal after changing the background. However this time the layout is more organized (line by line). I'm planning to make the text appears when the mouse moves to a certain point at a time. Each point will have a part of the overall message.

# Used functions

Conditional statement 

Loop

These are functions that I learnt from The Coding Train and used for testing
# Testing

Move the mouse horizontally to reveal hidden message

# Final banner
After experimenting trials and design iterations (Bubble Pop; Spiral Tunnel & Loop). Deciding which style to go what what functions to use, my final banner is a combination in ideations of previous testing trials.
I came out with a responsive banner (move the mouse and click to operate) which reveals design element after interacting.
I also made iteration in comment on how the text will be displayed (different design and color)
